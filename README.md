# Movie Profitability Analysis

The primary objective of this analysis is to explore the relationship between movie budgets and their generated profits, with a focus on the top five most common genres.

### The project aimed to achieve two main goals:
- Investigate how budget correlates with profitability, and visualize how the year of release affects the distribution of movies within the scatterplot.
- Develop a Linear Regression model to predict movie profit based on budget alone, evaluating the accuracy of such a model across different genres.

By analyzing each of the top five genres separately, the aim was to uncover if specific genres show a stronger correlation between budget and profitability.
